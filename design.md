# Personal Website Design: xiaoyuezhu.xyz

## Design Philosophy

**Core Vision**: A digital embodiment of the science of choice—where neuroscience meets AI meets real-world decision optimization. The website should feel like stepping into the mind of a decision architect who bridges the gap between how the brain makes choices and how technology can enhance human judgment.

**Design Ethos**: 
- *Minimal but meaningful* - Every element serves a purpose, like well-crafted decision frameworks
- *Scientific precision* with *decision clarity* - Clean data visualization aesthetics with interactive decision trees and choice architectures
- *Professional depth* - Sophisticated enough for academic credibility, practical enough for founders who need to make better decisions
- *Future-forward* - Showcasing the evolution from human intuition to AI-augmented decision-making
